Timing Matters:
Because changing habits disrupts your daily routine, it can be more effective to add new behaviours or remove unwanted ones when other big changes are. When making new changes to improve your pro, try to remember that it will take time to get used to and for it to be effective.
Start Small: 
Don’t make big changes when trying to improve your bad procrastination habits. It will only mess you up in the long run as well as mess with your plans. Try starting small. Take your time and each day, try to fix something small in your bad procrastination habits. This will help you last longer as you do it and it will benefit you as you don’t lose motivation, or get sick and tired of trying. 
Breaking a Habit:
Replacing a habit with something much more beneficial is much more helpful and better than actually getting rid of the bad habit. When you have an urge to do something or to do your bad habit, try to replace wit with something better and more beneficial than actually trying to eliminate your bad habit.
Keep Trying:
When you start improving your bad procrastination habits, there will be times where you will feel horrible and tired and think that it’s a waste of time for you to be doing this. But in all this hardship, you should still keep trying to improve your bad procrastination habits. When everything is fixed, you will thank yourself and award yourself for not giving up in bettering yourself. My tip is to use an app such as the Notes app or the Clock app to help and remind you to keep trying.
Consistent but Flexible:
Consistency is important when it comes to bettering yourself. Although you don’t feel motivated to continue improving your bad procrastination habits, it is still best to continue so that it is affecting your life for the better and in the long run. Continue to improve your procrastination habits even when you don’t feel motivated/don’t feel like doing it.
